# Datos² and EME

[Datos²](https://datos2.redesclimaticas.com/) is a platform offered by [OMIXOM](https://www.omixom.com/) that allows for the sharing, storing, and visualization of environmental data from citizen science projects, aiming for an exponential growth of data available to the community.

To contribute to the development of data-collecting devices, OMIXOM has designed [EME](https://github.com/ProyectoDatos2/Datos2/blob/284ac048665ba61753932678cd943c32ad25f8b8/Manual%20de%20uso%20proyecto%20Datos%20correcciones_compressed.pdf) (Educational Meteorological Station), a low-cost and easy-to-assemble meteorological station, ideal for educational projects in technology and environment. EME is equipped with a sensor system, telemetry, and autonomy that allows it to measure variables such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and UV radiation, uploading this data to the Datos² platform without the need for an electrical network.
